# Summary

The purpose of this project was to add elements to the PlanMyTrip app, which provides real-time suggestions for ideal hotels based off of a client's temperature preferences to determine vacation destinations. Each city have a marker layer that provides information on a hotel name, city name, country ID, the current maximum temperature. The OpenWeatherMap API enables requests for weather data, and the Google Maps and Places API enables requests for nearby searches for hotels and to map coordinates. The elements being added are a weather description for the filtered (prefered] cities dataset, and creating a travel itinerary map based off of a user selecting four cities, using the Google Maps Directions API, with a marker adding the current weather description.
